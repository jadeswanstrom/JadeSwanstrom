        <h1 class="intro"> Hi, I'm Jade! Its nice to meet you!</h1>
        <h2>I'm a software developer (in development hehe) </h2>
        <p>
          <strong> < background > </strong> I have worked in reception for most of my adult life! I love working with computers, seeing how they function, and learning efficient ways to do tasks! I also run an online art store where I make/sell digital artwork for Twitch streamers, website graphics, and Youtubers. <strong> < /background > </strong>
         </p>
         <p> <strong> < hobbies > </strong> I love gaming! I have loved playing games since I was a child. In 2021 my brother and I built custom PC's, and since then I have spent my free time playing games with friends, and learning how they are made! I also love to draw, and I have spent around a <strong>decade</strong> learning photoshop, graphic design, animation and digital art. In 2020 I started an online business selling my digital artwork, specifically making graphics for twitch streamers and youtubers. I still do this on the side to this day! <strong> < /hobbies > </strong>
        </p>
        <p> <strong> < career > </strong> I love coding, and hope to one day find a career where I can code, and make cool things! I am still in the beginning stages of learning software development, so I am not sure exactly which career path I will take, but I know I love to create things, and be creative! <strong> < /career > </strong>
        </p>
        <p>  <strong> < extras > </strong> I also have a dog named Tobi! He's my best bud and we love to go hiking, swimming, and camping together! <strong> < /extras > </strong>
